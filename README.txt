delete a file once uploaded. Kindly ignore these two(main.cpp, main.exe).




Though all controls are already given in game while a pro gamer can easily figure out what
they do ;D

Enhancements made:
1. Randomness: Position of emergence, velocity, gravity inside the box, angle of shoot, etc
                         are totally random within some fixed ranges for the coin.

1. Reflection of the coin: coin will emerge from the bottom and sink to bottom 
                                      rest of three walls will reflect it.

2. Bomb feature: Coin can "randomly" turn into a black bomb at any instance.

4. Lives Matter: You will get 5 lives(shown by '+') for each match which will get cut if u catch
                       a black bomb.

5. Blinking GAMEOVER: though u have to loose all your life to see this but if u loose all 5 lives, 
                                      a "blinking" notice of GAMEOVER will appear. Press 'r' to play again.

6. Highscore: There is a Highscore given to player to compete with. This highscore
                                            is for all games played but not just for a single game.
                                            game creates a .txt file whereever the game is located to store this info.
                                            You don't need to make that. Game will automatically create one if not 
                                           already existed and will set the Highscore to 0 initially.

some features were already there like variable speed of lasso  and changing angle
these are also modified a little like more variation in lasso speed and changing angle.
